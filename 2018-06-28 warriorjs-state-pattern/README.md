# WELCOME TO WARRIOR JS

## Description

This is a CLI game that Software Crafters attempted for a coding dojo to practice the application of state pattern.

It contains the progress of the solution that was developed during our Meetup session at Tabcorp Sydney.

## Starting / Loading

I've added a starting script to the package.json, so just run the below command to boot it up:

> npm start

## Contribution Guide

### Playing

- The file that you want to change is the `Player.js` file found at `/warriorjs/[character-name]/Player.js`

### Saving Progress

- Please assume that we all want to continue from where we left off, if you want to upload your progress just copy your current character folder into a new one so people can still view/continue the progress from where we left off.
